A basic kernel mode driver with a user mode application which allows it to attach to a specified process and read its memory as well as modify it. This project was created for learning purposes only and is not and will not be maintained. You are free to use the code for your own research and learning purposes, however, anything you do with it beyond that, and anything that does go wrong while playing around with a kernel mode driver is your own responsibility. 
RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK!
DO NOT RUN THIS DRIVER IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
